# About Trivia Base

An internship task for making a trivia application using the open trivia database API. Showcasing the MVC folder structure along with provider state management. The project will be documented as much as possible, favouring the intellisense on almost all the IDEs. I will include proper linting rules and awesome UI.

## Short Description
TRIVIA BASE
(a quiz application)

◘ User login/sign-up using Email Password or Google Id.

◘ Getting trivia from open trivia APIs according to values selected by user.

◘ Results are saved on Cloud Firestore Database.

◘ If user leaves trivia midway, he/she can retake it from the beginning with same set of questions
saved temporarily on Cloud Firestore until trivia is completed.

◘ Each time the trivia questions are fetched they are generated randomly on the server side. So no
two question sets are same even with same set of values chosen by the user.
